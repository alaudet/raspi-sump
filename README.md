Raspi-sump is a sump pit water level monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi and an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04).

Currently the system monitors the water level in your pit at defined intervals. It sends
email sms alerts if the water reaches a critical level, indicating a possible sump pump failure.

    sudo pip3 install --no-binary :all: raspisump


# Upgrading Raspi-Sump 

Upgrading an existing version

    sudo pip3 install -U --no-binary :all: raspisump

This will also install the [HCSR04sensor](https://github.com/alaudet/hcsr04sensor) 


Read the configuration docs copied during setup on your pi at the following location;

    /home/pi/raspi-sump/docs

They are also available on github https://github.com/alaudet/raspi-sump/blob/master/docs/install.md


# Upgrading from Python2 to Python3

    sudo pip uninstall raspisump
    sudo pip3 install --no-binary :all: raspisump


Your configuration file will be preserved in /home/pi/raspi-sump/

# Disclaimer

You are welcome to use Raspi-Sump but there is no guarantee it will work. Your house may still flood if your sump pump fails. This software comes with no warranty. See License details.

This is not a replacement for a properly maintained water pumping system. It is one tool you can use to give yourself extra piece-of-mind.

Best practices should include:

* A backup pump that triggers at a slightly higher water level than your main pump.
* The secondary pump should be connected to a seperate dedicated electrical breaker. 
* You should also have a generator that can provide power should you have an extended outage during the spring or other unseasonally wet time of year.
* if you are building a new home, pay attention to the grade of your property, as you may be able to let gravity empty your pit for you.  That would be the best approach with a backup pump for added protection.

Once you have done all of these things, then consider using a monitoring system like Raspi-Sump.
