[gpio_pins]

# Raspi-Sump uses the actual GPIO numbers and not the Pi numerical pin 
# numbers.  You can use any available GPIO's for Trig and Echo.

# Trig pin sends the signal.  Value is the number of the GPIO 
# on the RaspberryPi
trig_pin = 17

# Echo pin receives the signal.  Value is the number of the GPIO 
# on the RaspberryPi
echo_pin = 27


[pit]

# Unit of measure.  You may choose to use metric or imperial measurements.  
# The unit variable must be set as metric or imperial and is case sensitive.
# Any other setting will cause an error.
unit = metric

# critical_water_level is the water level in the sump pit at which point an 
# email alert should be triggered. 
# If unit = metric then critical_water_level = centimeters
# If unit = imperial then critical_water_level = inches
critical_water_level = 35 

# The pit_depth is the distance between the sensor and the bottom of the 
# sump pit.
# Like critical_water_level, enter centimeters for metric and inches for
# imperial
pit_depth = 72

# Set the number of seconds between readings.
# rsump.py is called from with systemd. See the install instructions (Systemd section).
# If the rsump.py process fails for any reason systemd will restart the process
# It is possible to take one reading only and have raspisump exit.  To do this make sure
# you stop the raspisump.service and set the reading_interval to 0
# When set to 0 raspisump takes one reading only and exits gracefully.
reading_interval = 60

# The temperature variable will adjust the speed of sound to reflect 
# the normal temperature of your basement.  
# If unit = metric then enter the temperature in Degrees Celcius.
# If unit = imperial then enter the temperature in Degrees Fahrenheit.
temperature = 20

# Raspi-Sump can also be used in situations where you would want to check if
# the water_level is too low. Sump pits are concerned with high water levels
# but a drinking water cistern would require an alert when it is low.  For that
# reason you can set the following value to 'low'.  Leave this value as is unless
# you specifically want alerts when the water drops below a certain level.
alert_when = high

[charts]
# This section deals with charting
# line_color takes a hex color value.

# red(ff0000), black(000000), blue(0000ff), default rsumporange(FB921D)
line_color = FB921D


[email]

# Set an appropriate interval for alerts.  If you are taking readings at short
# intervals it is possible to bombard yourself with SMS text messages when the
# water reaches a critical level.  For example if you are taking a reading
# every minute or less an SMS Email alert will be sent each time the reading is
# taken.  By setting the alert_interval this allows you to receive an email
# alert at a more appropriate time interval.  Readings will continue and will
# be logged but SMS text alerts will only be sent as you define it.  
# alert_interval is set in minutes. The default is 5 minutes if this value is not present.
alert_interval = 5 


# SMTP Server requires authentication (0=No, 1=Yes)

# SMTP Server Information
# Most SMTP servers are now supporting ssl over tls.  However you can
# explicitely request tls if need to.
# leaving both tls and ssl to zero will omit encryption entirely.
# Select 1 for either, but never both.
# For Gmail set smtp_ssl to 1.  Gmail can also use tls if needed for the time
# being.
# Office 365 Mail uses TLS

# SMTP Server uses TLS (0=No, 1=Yes)

# For Gmail, activate these values with your gmail username and app password.

# Office 365 also uses app password
