# Support

To help troubleshoot an issue run the support.py file as follows

    support.py

This will create a file called `support.txt` in the `raspi-sump/support` folder that can be shared to help troublshoot an issue.

The file does not gather any personal information, it simply gathers information about your setup that can help in diagnosing issues.
