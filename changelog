Raspi-Sump Changelog
====================

Version 1.5rc1
- Fixed bug in rsumpmonitor.py that was not restarting the process
- Fix lighttpd.conf for proper create-mime.conf.pl location

Version 1.4.1
- Unpinned Raspi-Sump to a specific version of hcsr04sensor in setup.py
- Updated install instructions.

Version 1.4
- Add on demand email testing with command 'emailtest's

Version 1.3
- Add support for Raspberry Pi OS 11 (codename bullseye)

Version 1.2.3
- pinned to hcsr04sensor dependency >=1.6 in setup.py

Version 1.2.2
- hcsr04sensor v1.6 module no longer handles rounding of readings.  Now handled by Raspi-Sump
- reading.py now using depth method in hcsr04sensor as depth_metric and depth_imperial are deprecated.

Version 1.2.1
- Add section to conf file to change line color in the charts.
  [charts]
  line_color = FB921D  #default

Version 1.2
- Add hostname to email alert body to better identify which instance of raspisump is alerting
- Add a heartbeat email at a user defined interval to ensure that email is working as intended

Version 1.1.2
- Fix charts displaying improper hour formatting on x axis when using matplotlib version 2 in Raspbian Stretch.

Version 1.1.1 
- prevent application from logging negative waterlevels.

Version 1.1
- Add error logging to identify possible faulty cables or sensors. Versions
prior to this would only hang and consume 100% CPU.  As of this version a
faulty cable or sensor will cause the application to exit gracefully and write
a log to '/home/pi/raspi-sump/logs/error_log' alerting you to a faulty cable or
sensor.

Example;

2016-11-26 10:26:42,**ERROR - Signal not received. Possible cable or sensor problem.


Version 1.0.2
- minor addition to alerts.py.  Adds a timestamp to the alert message body. Thanks to Brian Heiland for the suggestion.


Version 1.0.1
- minor change to alerts.py that still had a line for testing code in it.

it is now fully Python2 and Python3 compatible.
- Important info added for Gmail users to send alerts.  See issue tracker;
https://github.com/alaudet/raspi-sump/issues/6


Version 0.8.0
- Option to receive alerts on low water levels instead of high. This would allow
you to monitor a drinking water source for example.


Version 0.7.0
- Add option to limit SMS Email alerts to a defined interval to prevent
spamming yourself with alerts every minute or less.  Can now be set in the
raspisum.conf file as alert_interval.  Default is 5 minutes if option is not
